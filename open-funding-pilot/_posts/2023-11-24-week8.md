## 20 - 24 November 2023
As a reminder, we are a team from Sport England and [FF Studio](https://www.ff.studio/) working together on the Open Funding Pilot.

It will help Sport England try new ways of working and new funding models to enable them to get more people in underserved communities active. It will also show the wider Sport England organisation what delivery looks like if we [shorten feedback cycles](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/shorten-feedback-loops-reduce-teams-stress).

Weeknotes are a quick recap of the important things a team has done each week, what we‚Äôve learned, and what‚Äôs the plan for next week. They also help us work in the open.

This is the end of week 8.

## 1. The service

Big news first: we‚Äôve named the fund. ‚ÄúOpen Funding Pilot‚Äù isn‚Äôt a very good name for what‚Äôs ultimately a closed pilot. So we explored some new names (see below) and came to a quick decision yesterday afternoon. 2024 Pilot Fund, welcome to the world.

In other news, we‚Äôve done one more iteration of the form based on feedback from IMT. We‚Äôre happy with it. It‚Äôs looking good, and IMT‚Äôs feedback has helped us to dial in on some of the more technical details that we were missing. Thank you Sian for your constant, ongoing support and hard work, and thank you James and Claire for your helpful critique and advice.

As we‚Äôre getting closer to our launch date in December, we‚Äôve been writing the emails that will go to applicants. Theory and ideas about how to run things really come into clear focus when you want to email your users. The final snags - does everyone agree? - are rearing their head as we get the emails written.

(In some ways it‚Äôs like week 2 when we made a prototype form so that our ‚Äúwhat about‚Ä¶‚Äù questions were more real.) Are we sure **_we are sure_** that the limit is ¬£250k? Because it becomes real once it is emailed.

## 2. The assessment

So we spent dedicated time this week getting the assessment design into its final (ish) shape. We will be doing rolling assessments from when we open. We will assess the applications against a set of criteria and principles rather than against each other which was the assumed model if we were to do them all in one go.

We decided this in hand with RFI as it felt like a better collective experience to do it this way.

## The ways of working

After a couple of weeks where scope has shifted more times than we expected our watch words this week have been clarity and focus.

Our [kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) (a fancy agile term for todo list - sorry everyone üòÄ) was starting to get a bit messy: some items covered too much information, and others with not enough. This is all very usual for this stage in a 12 week agile project. Finding the correct fidelity for a todo is always a bit of an art form.

Anyway, having a small focused team meant we all knew what we were doing every day, but we weren‚Äôt able to track the work as well as we could have. So we‚Äôve labelled the board, deleted the items that didn‚Äôt help us, made sure all the others were the right size. Serenity returns. And it makes it much easier to communicate to people who are less involved day to day. In this kind of work, the north star is a healthy team rapidly creating genuine value for users and the organisation. Everything else - the board, the tasks, the documentation, the meetings - are there to serve that north star, so we are comfortable making changes when we need to.


## Next week

* Review assessment process and criteria.
* Lock down the form.
* Make a plan for any incomplete documentation.
* Support Transformation team at Investment Committee and ELT meetings.
