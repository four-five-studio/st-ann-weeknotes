## What is a weeknote?

Q - What's a weeknote?

A - [DXW describe it best in their playbook](https://playbook.dxw.com/delivery-management/weeknotes/). Our take is these are a way to speak like a human to people who might be interested in the work we are doing - with all the challanges and fun that doing that brings. It's a place to [radiate our intent](https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/dont-ask-forgiveness-radiate-intent-d36fd22393a3) and gather feedback

Q - Why do you want to do that?

A - [Working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu) is so inviting. Being inviting is great. Hopefully these weeknotes have a bit of character to them - we hope you read and enjoy them.

Q - Who else has done them?

A - Loads of people. This is a copy of the Welsh Revenue Service [(literally, we copied the code)](https://welsh-revenue-authority.github.io/property-data-poc/en/). Beyond that there is a [whole community of people that do them](https://weeknot.es/). [BERG are probably the OGs](https://berglondon.com/blog/tag/weeknotes/).

Q - How do I find out more?

A - About this project? email anna@ff.studio or eliot@ff.studio

A - About weeknotes? Probably [Giles](https://gilest.org/wra-weeknotes.html), but [first buy his book](https://agilecommshandbook.com/).
